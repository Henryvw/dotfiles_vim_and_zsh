#Henry's Setup

1. Install Macvim using Homebrew
2. For the Oh My Zsh shapes in the command line you must install power fonts using pip install --user powerline-status
3. iTerm2 must be set to 256 colors to process VIM color schemes like my standard color scheme, Monokai
4. There must be specific background colors set via "highlight" in .vimrc in order to match iterm2's background color, and in order to avoid the weird discrepancy between NON-TEXT and NORMAL (TEXT) in VIM.
